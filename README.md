# mallowz
Mallowz is an insecure webshop based on Apache, PHP and mySQL / mariaDB. 
It caused me physical pain to deliberately put the vulnerabilities in the code. 
But what the heck. The store can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, 
capture the flags and covers very many of the vulnerabilities discussed by OWASP.
