# mallowz
Mallowz is an insecure webshop based on Apache, PHP and mySQL / mariaDB. 
It caused me physical pain to deliberately put the vulnerabilities in the code. 
But what the heck. The store can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, 
capture the flags and covers very many of the vulnerabilities discussed by OWASP.

In this repository, I'd like to explain the different approaches to building this store - starting with the system architecture. The store can be run on a ubuntu system with LAMP or a Windows system with xamp. Installation instructions for this can be found as well as tutorials for building a Docker environment in microservice architecture as well as a monolithic Docker approach.
